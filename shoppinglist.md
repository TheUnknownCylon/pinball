Having a hobby costs money. Just for my own sake, I would like to know how
much money I have spent so far on this pinball machine. I'll provide the numbers
here. If you are building your own machine, you can you can use this to get an
indication on what a custom machine would cost you.

**Bonus**: this list is a nice overview on what hardware you can select.
